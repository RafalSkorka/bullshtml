bullshtml is apache license 2.0. 
Internally, it uses the jsmooth to export the jar file to win32 exe.
Unfortunately jsmooth itself is GPL and the skeleton for exe generation is LGPL.
That's why I don't distribute those in bullshtml code.

To make the win32 exe, you should download jsmooth binaray,
copy the lib/jsmoothgen-ant.jar file and skeletons direcotry in antlib directory.
and ant task using "ant packagewindow"

To make the linux, it is not necessary to copy jsmooth binaries, just run following
packagelinux ant task using "ant packagelinux".
